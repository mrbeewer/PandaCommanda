# PandaCommanda
This is the first game made at our first Game Jam. Theres still work to be done but we will get to that :)

Concept:
Panda Commanda is inspired by games like Ikaruga where the action is dependent of the “phase” in which the player is in.
I idea behind this game is that in order to destroy X type of object you just hit it will like X bullets. This game is also co-op and meant to have one Desktop player and one mobile player. The desktop players  job is to destroy as many blocks as possible while keeping their energy and health up. The mobile players job is to change to type of any “odd” typed objects to an appropriate one. In the first iteration of Panada Commanda the destroyable objects are either blue or red and the “odd” type objects are black. The mobile play must choose which color to change it to in order for the desktop player to destroy it. The mobile play is also in charge of gathering up and charging energy for the desktop player to use. No energy means no bullets.

Work Done****
Desktop
So far the basics of this concept have been implemented. Desktop players can move around and shoot while changing their bullet types. Firing reduces energy of that type. Blocks of different types also spawn and approach the player in a random fashion. 

Mobile
Mobile player can connect and observe the action in the scene. Player has the ability to change the type of a block by selecting they type they want to change it to and then tapping the block. Once the desktop player has destroy a block there is a chance for a “energy supply” to be dropped which increases the available amount of energy. Player can tap on the supply and allocate it to the energy type of their choice

Work to be done****
Desktop
There is no way to win currently nor any way to lose. 
Would like the game to be in  a Black and White theme to fit the awesome title (Panada Commanda)
Add additional bullet types 
fix spawning issues 

Mobile
create a better way to replenish energy
create system to keep mobile player active in monitoring energy supplies and reacting to it accordingly
